# Inifiniteloader

In this repo, have just created an infinite loader, so basically through an api have fetched some images and rendered them, so whenever the scroll bar is scrolled to the extreme bottom it loads a spinner for a while and then again fetch some images and adds it to the existing images on the browser so in this way scroller size increases and you can further scroll them to the bottom to view further images.
